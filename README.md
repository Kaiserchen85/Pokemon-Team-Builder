## Pokemon Creator and Team Builder

**What does this application do?**
- Add Pokemon to teams
  - Add items, typing, moves and base stat total to Pokemon
- Create new Pokemon
- Check overall stats(power) of teams

**Who will use it?**

Anyone who wants build a team of Pokemon for any purpose they'd like 
such as planning a team for a game they want to play.

**Why is this of interest to me?**

I really enjoy playing Pokemon and while I may not have all the games, 
one thing I enjoy doing is building teams regardless. 
Thus, I thought it would be neat if I could build a small team builder using the current knowledge I have!
